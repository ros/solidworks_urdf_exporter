## Latest Release
https://github.com/ros/solidworks_urdf_exporter/releases/tag/1.5.1

## Usage

See the [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/sw_urdf_exporter) and associated [tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/sw_urdf_exporter/Tutorials).

## Development

1. Install Visual Studio 2017
1. Install .NET desktop development
    1. From Visual Studio: `Tools > Get Tools and Features...`
    1. Check `.NET desktop development` package
    1. Select `Modify`
1. Launch Visual Studio with admin privileges. Right click and select `Run as Administrator`
1. Open `sw2urdf/SW2URDF.sln`  
1. Enable Debugging
    1. Right click `SW2URDF` in the Solution Explorer
    1. Click the `Debug` Tab
    1. Ensure `Configuration:` is set to `Debug`
    1. Ensure `Start external program:` is pointing to the SolidWorks executable. For example `C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS\SLDWORKS.exe`

### Trouble Shooting

1. `AxImp.exe` error - Check the installation of the .Net Tools. If there is no error, install the Windows 10 SDK.
1. `Resourse.resx` error - Check if `sw2urdf/SW2URDF/Resources.resx` exists and is empty. If empty, delete this file then right click the `SW2URDF` in the Solution Explorer and select `Properties`. Navigate to the Resources tab and click the button to create a new file.
1. Mesh coordinate error - Check the version of SolidWorks and Service Pack. SolidWorks 2019 or Service Pack 5 is required. See [this issue](https://github.com/ros/solidworks_urdf_exporter/issues/73).
